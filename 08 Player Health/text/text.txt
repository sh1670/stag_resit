As an extension to the basic game, you might like to add a "health level" feature.
Each player should start with a health level of 3.
Consumption of "Poisons & Potions" or interaction with beneficial or dangerous characters will increase or decrease a player's health.
You will see in the "extended" actions file the use of the `health` keyword in the `consumed` and `produced` fields.

When a player's health runs out (i.e. reaches zero) they should lose all of the items in their inventory
(which are dropped in the location where they ran out of health) and then they should return to the start location.
In order to implement these features in your game engine, you should also add a new `health` command keyword
that reports back the player's current health level (so the player can keep track of it).
