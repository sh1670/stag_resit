Your game should be able to operate with more than just a single player.
In order to support this, each incoming command message will begin with a username
(to identify which player has issued the command)

A full incoming message might therefore take the form of:
```
Simon: open door with key
```

It is essential that when an incoming message is received, the command is applied to the correct player !

Note that there is no need for your server to implement any form of authentication - 
you can assume that the client handles this responsibility.
You will however need to maintain game state for each player encountered
(e.g. each player may be in a different location and will carry their own inventory of items etc.)

Note that there is no formal player registration process - when the server encounters a command from
a previously unseen user, a new player should be create in the start location of the game.
