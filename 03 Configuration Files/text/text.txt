The game description files passed into the server contain the following two aspects of the game:

- Entities: "things" in the game, their structural layout and the relationships between them
- Actions: the dynamic behaviours of the entities within the game

Because these two types of data are very different in nature, we have chosen two different documents formats to represent them:

- DOT: A language for expressing graphs (which is basically what a text adventure game is !)
- JSON: A language for expressing structured data (which we will use to store the actions)

You already have much experience of writing parsers ! We don't want to cover old ground,
so you will NOT be required to build your own parsers for these document formats.
Instead, you are able to use two existing parsing libraries. There is considerable educational value in learning to use existing libraries and frameworks in this way.

For parsing DOT files you should use the
<a href="http://www.alexander-merz.com/graphviz/doc.html" target="_blank">JPGD library</a>
(a jar file of this library can be found <a href="resources/libs/dot-parser.jar" target="_blank">here</a>).
For parsing JSON files you should use the
<a href="http://alex-public-doc.s3.amazonaws.com/json_simple-1.1/index-all.html" target="_blank">JSON-simple library</a>
(a jar file of this library can be found <a href="resources/libs/json-parser.jar" target="_blank">here</a>).
To illustrate how parsing libraries may be used, a <a href="resources/code/GraphParserExample.java" target="_blank">rough code fragment</a> is provided to illustrate reading in and printing out the content of DOT files. Note that this example is very "raw" code - you will need to refactor it if you make use of it in your own project.
