You are encouraged to discuss assignments and possible solutions with other students.
HOWEVER it is essential that you only submit your own work.
This may feel like a grey area, however if you adhere to the following advice, you should be fine:

- Never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, USB stick, GIT, printouts or photos !)
- Although pair programming is encouraged in some circumstances, on this unit you must type your own work !
- It's OK to seek help from online sources (e.g. Stack Overflow) but don't just cut-and-paste chunks of code...
- If you don't understand what a line of code actually does, you shouldn't be submitting it !
- Don't submit anything you couldn't re-implement under exam conditions (with a good textbook !)

An automated checker will be used to flag any incidences of possible plagiarism.
If the markers feel that intentional plagiarism has actually taken place, marks may be deducted.
In serious or extensive cases, the incident may be reported to the faculty plagiarism panel.
This may result in a mark of zero for the assignment, or perhaps even the entire unit
(if it is a repeat offence).
Don't panic - if you stick to the above list of advice, you should remain safe !
